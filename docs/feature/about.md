    <br>
    Unlike most vertical technical blogs, the categories here will be very diverse, including <b>tutorials and practical knowledge</b>, <b>life anecdotes and tips</b>, and <b>thoughts and ideas on various topics</b>. Whatever I research or discover, I will share it here.
    <br>
    This is the original intention of creating this small site, and it is also <b>my way of sharing life</b>. I am fortunate to meet you here, and I believe we can leave behind some wonderful memories together.
